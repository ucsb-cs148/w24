# Announcements
* Today (part of lab04): 
  * MVP video demonstrations with peer eval 
  * Voting for favorite MVPs from your Section
  * Celebration of our progress
  * You get points from today's activities to finish up the [lab04 deliverables](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w23/lab/lab04/) 
  
* Lab05: Over the following week you will continue MVP peer evaluation on Tuesday, work on continued functionality development, and do some unit testing towards test-based design! 
* Don't forget Sprint Review and Sprint Planning Meetings 

* Next week (Lab06), we'll hold the Second Retrospective (the MVP release is a great opportunity to review the next steps)


# Procedure for Today's MVP Review

We will play your MVP videos in the order below. After each video is played, we will have Q&A, and during and after the presentation you will collect feedback on a Google Form we posted on the new Slack mvp-presentation channel.  

**12pm Section:** 
```
T01 - cookbooksocial (T05 asks a question)
T02 - fouryearscheduleplanner (T03 asks a question)
T03 - cheapskate (T01 asks a question)
T05 - telekineticgame (T02 asks a question)
``` 
**1pm Section:** 
```
T04 - interactivesolarsystem (T07 asks a question)
T06 - fitnessandnutritiontracker (T08 asks a question)
T07 - studygroup (T06 asks a question)
T08 - buddyup (T04 asks a question)
``` 
**2pm Section:** 
```
T09 - musicrecommendation (T10 asks a question) 
T10 - weeklyschedule (T11 asks a question)
T11 - proceduralgeneration (T09 asks a question) 
``` 

&nbsp;

* Everyone will **take notes and submit a quick peer-feedback form** on each other presentation in your section while watching the presentations during class. 
    * Please fill in the review form announced on Slack during your session during the video presentations. Submission of this form will count towards your lab04 points. If you cannot attend today's lecture, you can watch the [prepared videos](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dXhvtRPpwhPkopjN_JF59bV_RtqDguA2QaIEntIMFLk/edit?usp=sharing) and fill the form in before the end of this lab. 

<br />   
*After each video presentation, a representative from *the group listed above as being teamed with you* will **ask a question** to the team whose video was just shown. That question should be typed in a special Slack Channel @mvp-presentation (so that we capture it) and read out by the representative for the team asking the question. 
    * The question can be of any type, e.g. a follow-up on something that was not entirely clear, a low-level implementation question, a question about possible future functionality, or a high-level question about the product landscape connected to the project. 

<br />
* After the peer team asked their question, there will be an opportunity for **anyone to ask a question** to the team whose video was shown, but if there are many questions, we may have to cut it short. We ask that any questions that are asked be captured in the Slack channel! We also may chime in with questions and comments from the teaching team. 

* After all project videos have been shown, everyone will be asked to **vote for their favorite MVPs**. You will receive the link to that review form in the Slack channel.  We will announce the audience choice award winner for best MVP in your Section next week, as well as on Slack (which gives you bragging rights, but no influence on your grades. Grades will solely be based on final product presentations and quality).  

# Celebrate

We want to **celebrate** with you on how far you have already come - We are really proud and excited about every single team's progress since the start of the quarter. It's a journey, and we should enjoy it!
