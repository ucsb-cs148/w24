# Announcements
* **Second CATME peer eval**: You earn 20 individual points towards lab06 for submitting feedback on overall team performance via a second CATME.org form survey that you got email invitations for today. Deadline for submittting these is **Friday 02/23/23, 11:59pm PDT**.
* [Homework assignment h08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/hwk/h08/) on SW Design Patterns / Code Smells posted. Due next Wednesday. 

* **Focus on your projects**. Lab work in the coming weeks will focus on documentation (**design document**, **user manual**) in order to get your documents started and to utilize cycles of team members not central to ongoing implementation efforts at any given time. 
** Project documentation will happen in three major documents: 
    * **design document** (to be started in lab07),
    * **user manual** (to be started in lab08))
    * **deployment instructions** (started already for MVP, crucial for deployment/UX peer review in week 9 (Mon., 03/04) and Github **README.md**, which should explain the code folder hierarchy and guide through the implementation effort. 
* Project presentations (Final exam slot, March 18th, 4-7pm)

Here, again, is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual
