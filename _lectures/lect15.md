You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations. Please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the quality of the instructor's teaching (Question A) and the overall quality of the course (Question B). 

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Here is some information from the university [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f-HbQTHngmb9qk92SvPyKSrzToC0B04W4wKCB3FRsFA/edit?usp=sharing), [video](https://gauchocast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ac7b37e-20a3-44c4-8cb7-b09201873ec3) on giving helpful feedback. 

Thank you all for taking the time!
