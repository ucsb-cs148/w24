# Announcements
* **Second CATME peer eval results just released**: Please discuss with your teams. Use this to keep the team focused and every team member accountable. 
* [Homework assignment h08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/hwk/h08/) on SW Design Patterns and Code Smells still due on Wednesday. 
* **REMINDER:** Next Monday (03/04) we will do an inter-team eval of your app deployment, functionality, UX. In this week's lab you should determine a question you'd like to have the other team answer about your product.    


* **Focus on your projects**. Lab work in the coming weeks will focus on documentation (**design document**, **user manual**) in order to get your documents started and to utilize cycles of team members not central to ongoing implementation efforts at any given time. 
** Project documentation will happen in three major documents: 
    * **design document** (to be started in lab07),
    * **user manual** (to be started in lab08))
    * **deployment instructions** (started for MVP peer review) and Github **README.md**, which should explain the code folder hierarchy and guide through the implementation effort. 
* Project presentations (Final exam slot, Mon, March 18th, 4-7pm)
