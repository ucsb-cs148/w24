# Announcements

* Sorry, no crashers! Class enrollment is final (we are already overenrolled and will form groups immediately)

* Please fill out the [Student Survey](https://bit.ly/148w24-survey) (required for enrolled students)

# Team

* We have three TAs: Kristin Hu, Aditya Sharma, and Luke Yoffe
* There are five Learning Assistants: Ryan He, Anushka Lodha, Matthew Nguyen, Mateo Wang, Christopher Chang
* We have three Lab Sections: Friday noon PDT, 1pm, and 2pm. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours
where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.
